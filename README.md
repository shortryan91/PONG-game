i created this repo to show my game of pong that i learned how to make just using a video on youtube 

##languages 
for this project the languages used were 
-HTML
-CANVAS
-JAVASCRIPT

###notes 
this was my first time using canavs so it was very interesting to learn the basics of the skill and how it works with the javascript to create the graphic's and how you can use functions to make it even easier to write the canvas element
